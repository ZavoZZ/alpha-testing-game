## 📌 Guidelines for New Session Logs

When creating new session logs:

1. Create a new folder with today's date: `YYYY-MM-DD/`
2. Document fixes, debugging steps, and implementations
3. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `FIX_FEATURE_NAME.md`, `DEBUG_ISSUE_NAME.md`)
4. Include timestamps and context for future reference

*Session logs help track development history and debugging processes.*
